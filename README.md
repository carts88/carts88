## Hola, Person! 👋

Hey! I’m **Carter**, a freshman **Computer Science** student with a strong interest in **sports analytics and data-driven decision making**.

I’ve always been drawn to the statistical side of sports, which naturally led me into **data analysis**. What started as building spreadsheets has since evolved into writing code and creating tools.

Currently, I’m working with:
- **Python** and **SQL** for data analysis and modeling  
- **JavaScript / TypeScript** and frameworks like **React** for data visualization and interactive tools  

As I continue to build my skill set, my goal is to release a collection of **NHL-focused analytical tools**, ranging from interactive calculators to projection and evaluation models.
