## Hola, Person! 👋

My name is Carter, I'm a freshman Computer Science student!

I'm a big sports fan and have always loved the statistical side of sports. This interest has driven me to get started in data analysis.

For me, this started with building spreadsheets; however has now transitioned to coding.

Currently, I'm tinkering around with various languages such as Python, SQL for data analysis, in addition to JavaScript/TypeScript frameworks like React, to complement the data analysis with data visualization. 

As I build up my skills, I hope to release multiple evaluative and informative NHL Tools from interactive calculators to projection models.

## Previous Projects! 👋
-> NHL Fantasy/Dynasty Spreadsheet - Basically, the sheet replicated normal fantasy hockey with twists, scores were based more on box score stats to create a modified version of gamescore (created by Dom Luszczyszyn of The Athletic). The stat was meant to quantify a player's value to a team getting points.
-> NHL Draft Consensus Sheet - This sheet includes rankings of popular draft pundits. Those rankings are then compiled into a weighted and unweighted consensus, with various data points available to show for each player, measuring how well the pundits like said players.
