## Hola, Person! 👋

I am Carter, a freshman Computer Science student.

I'm a big sports fan, and have always loved statistical side of sports. This interest has driven me too combine my personal interests with coding. 

Currently I'm tinkering around with various languages such as Python, SQL for data analysis in addition to javascript/typescript framworks like React to bring a marketable and informative view to the data.

As I build up my skills, I hope to release multiple evaluative, and informative NHL Tools from interactive calculators, to projection models.
